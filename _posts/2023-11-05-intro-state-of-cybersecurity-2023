Welcome to my blog, recently I was involved in some automation work that highlighted my lack of experince with software development, CI/CD pipelines, and git in general.  Historically I have a Windows engineering background and have written functional scripts, in a variety of languages, many of which are still in production or production systems today.  This is an attempt at managing a personal blog using a SSG, Jekyll and Github Pages.  Throughout the week I want to highlight the state of the cybersecurity industry in 2023, this year has been rife with ransomware, persistent threat actors, and geopolitical strife.  Additionally we keep hearing about a cybersecurity talent shortage and a ton of job openings, I want to dive into this topic and many more.

I invite you to join me on this expedition. Follow along, contribute your thoughts, and let's decode the mysteries of cybersecurity together.
